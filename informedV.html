                        <p>Rapid structures have rapidly evolved to define architectural paradigms. Their sheer scale, visual prominence, and symbolic potential have rendered them a speculative enterprise, economically, technologically and architecturally.
                            espite their close relationship to other building typologies, vertical structures have created a provocative and unique range or urban spaces; a speculative terrain of vertical extension. 
                            Their design is often calibrated to urban forces and building technologies.
                            A representative of urbanity, of density and of modernity, vertical structures present a unique challenge to architects and architecture. 
                            However, the emergence of the new verticallity was at large confined to modernist style of repetitive vertical stack of floors, thus producing undifferentiated, unrelated, retro style vertical structures that dominate a skyline.
                        </p>

                        <p>in.Formed.ed Verticallity explored ‘data embodiment strategies’ to inform the generation of vertical digital morphologies through the integration of specific set of conditions and rules.
                            I explored data processing morphologies of self-organizing processes to generate digital systems using advanced mesh modeling techniques and assessed their application in development of differentiated complex systems of vertical structures; starting with a simple formation and moving into more complex ones.
                            The use of algorithmic design methodologies through the integration of selected information and data articulation to generate spatial and architectural vertical formations.

                        <p>The construction history of Zagreb has always prioritized an environmental philosophy to design through looking at the city as an extension of nature and its resources. 
                            Zagreb’s new observation tower aims to reinstate this philosophy in an age of climate illness by using land art as medium between earth and space.
                            Balanced composition of abstract rock stacks is used formally and structurally to create volumetric enclosures and different spaces to intensify the perceptual engagement with the city.
                            Spatially, the tower offers its visitors multiple experiences through observing the scenery from within, on-top and beneath the rocks; sometimes from narrow fissures while at other moments a panoramic view is revealed. 
                            The tower advances the art of high-rise by creating a progressive work-flow between the digital tools and fabrication crafts that will in turn benefit Zagreb’s construction economy.
