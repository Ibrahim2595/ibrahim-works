                        <p>With the increase in population all over the world, densifying the city is a better solution than the expected uncontrolled urban sprawl. With that comes a lot of issues, one of which is: can we still rely on natural resources to feed ourselves?  Analyzing today’s environmental crisis, the answer seems like a definite no. Besides the scarcity of resources, the increase in water and air pollution and the excessive use of artificial hormones and fertilizers, our existing source of food will no longer be our ideal option. Studies have proved that an unhealthy diet would lead to various health issues, one of which is stress, expected to be the most common disease in 2020. Dubai imports most of its food sources, and the process of delivery consumes a lot of energy and adds to the low food quality.
                        </p>

                        <p>Proposing alternative food resources will not only help feed the planet, but also reduce the energy and water consumption, since for example agriculture consumes 70% of the world’s fresh water. Produce and animal products can now be harvested all year long and not only under the mercy of harsh weather conditions. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The project started with new relationships between systems, mainly relationships between masses and volumes. Through 2D and 3D, technicaland gestural drawings the project explored affects of sectionally trapped objects. Where masses and volumes collide, figures, fluid geometries and bi-directional gestures allow the two to flow into one another while remaining discrete at other moments. The aim was to find a formal and spatial language that would be used to create a vertical environment that combines material and formal intelligence, public building and a large-scale production factory.  </p>
                        <p>
                            Applying this language into a vertical urban farm, the system was translated into a hybrid of shell and column structure that locks the translucent volumes. The sectionally trapped volumes house produce technological farms as well as lab grown meat, mushroom grown mycelium walls and bee farms. The factory is morphed with an educational program through projecting the production process into the perimeter of the volumes and using the clear space between the shells and the volumes for human circulation and products transportation lines. This intersection of a factory program and a museum circulation aims to attract visitors from all age groups into getting a very close look at the full process of modern food supplies. The building will also produce a sustainable higher amount of food with much smaller footprint.

                        <p>
                            Formally the shell tares, splits and folds to correspond to programmatic and pragmatic needs. The shell thickens and hybridize with a denser cluster of columns for structural requirements.
