                        <p>Moving beyond false assumptions that nurture a passive understanding of structure as an a-spatial and secondary system in architecture, the intent of the project was to develop prototypical architectural construct that privilege an understanding of structure and its constituent parts as space-generating. </p>

                        <p>Looking at the work of earlier structural rationalists such as Eduardo Torroja, Felix Candela, Pier Luigi Nervi, Heinz Isler, Robert Maillard, Eladio Dieste and Jørn Utzon to resist a culture of linear design attitudes that supports form over structure and materials. Rethinking the linear process of “form, structure, material” towards a circular process between material properties, structural solutions and formal/spatial patterns to explore structures that are spatial, performative and poetic.
                        </p>

                        <p>Draping Mass is an architectural research project that investigates the relationship between lightness and massiveness through spatial conditions that occur from the use of inverted domes. Specifically, the project explores the inverted dome structure, its formal aspects, construction techniques, its relation to ground, sky and its ability to create enclosure.
                        </p>

                        <p>The dome, a significant element in Islamic architecture is used widely for its structural behavior and cultural role. Historically, the dome underwent many evolutions and variations. Here, the project inverts as well as transforms the typically smooth surface into a textured one through an inversion casting process. The casting process and the form-work studies revealed textures and spatial qualities that informed the layers that came next, culminating in a hybrid of cast-in-fabric concrete domes and a tectonic steel structure that enhances the pinching effect of the fabric and helps bridge between the domes and the spatial organization. 
                        </p>

                        <p> This research is deployed in an architectural scenario as a gallery and workshop space on Sheikh Zayed road in Dubai, UAE, where the structure is adjusted in scale and proportion to accommodate programmatic needs and site conditions.
                            In addition, some of the limitations of the system are geometries with small curvature radii and large overhangs. </p>
