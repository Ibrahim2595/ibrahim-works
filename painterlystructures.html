                        <p>The proposed Project describes an ongoing agenda and body of work that aims to disrupt prevailing tendencies within computationally design practices that privilege prefabrication and precision, as well as critique highly standardized modes of sustainable design production.
                            he paper is structured in three parts. First, it will describe a theoretical framework built around the idea of painterliness in contemporary practice. Second, it will describe how this theoretical framework is deployed in project-based scenarios.
                            Finally, it will project two avenues of development that this agenda is undergoing to expand its production scale and scope. 

                        </p>

                        <p>I begin by creating parallels between the radical shift from the linear to the painterly in the development of European representational art styles between the Late-Renaissance and the Baroque and the context of computational design methodologies and digital fabrication.
                            In Heinrich Wolfflin’s seminal work, Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art, he defines the painterly, which emerged in the early Baroque, through allusions to limitlessness and merging, which are in direct opposition to the tangibility and solidity of the Late Renaissance linear style.
                            Wolfflin describes the painterly as limitless, receding, open, lacking in linear hierarchy (ambiguous part-to-whole relationships), and finally of relative clarity, in comparison to the absolute clarity found in Late-Renaissance art (Wolfflin 1915). 

                        </p>

                        <p>Wolfflin describes the painterly as limitless, receding, open, lacking in linear hierarchy (ambiguous part-to-whole relationships), and finally of relative clarity, in comparison to the absolute clarity found in Late-Renaissance art (Wolfflin 1915). 
                            hese projects are situated as a critique of mass-customization and sustainable design, looking at the potential of scavenging fallen non-standard timber members from the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to produce an architectural material system. 
                            The projects I paper rely on self-supporting reciprocal frame typologies that requires no mechanical or subtractive connections.
                        </p>

                        <p> Finally, the project aim for ongoing developments on two different fronts. First, a digital platform and workflow is being developed as a stand-alone package that would allow for existing 3D meshes to be sorted, matched and assembled based on designer criteria. 
                            This would allow for the democratization of construction materials, where anything can essentially become a useful raw material. 
                            The second front includes working on large scale constructs that apply the theoretical framework with the workflow to produce spatial constructs, further testing the viability of the theoretical framework and material system.
